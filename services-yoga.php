            <span class="inpara-article">Join one of the best yoga teachers in Victoria, Rita Madou Yi, and learn yoga from the ground up. Some health insurance funds cover yoga classes, the rebate amount is dependent on individual health insurance funds.</span>
            <h2 class="inpara-head2">Who is for this? </h2>
            <span class="inpara-article">This class is designed for those who have more than 12 months of regular yoga practice. It utilises a dynamic and energetic practice with challenging and creative poses to boost strength and flexibility.</span>
            <h2 class="inpara-head2">Why yoga?</h2>
            <span class="inpara-article">Anxiety or stress usually triggers the sympathetic nervous system which will have manifestations such as increased blood pressure, tensed muscles, lack of concentration, faster breathing, and yoga helps to calm that down. Dr Manoj Kutteri, wellness director at Atmantan Wellness Centre, says, “Yoga is a great tool as the stretching poses help to reduce tension in muscles and joints, and this can, in turn, help relax the sympathetic system. There are many yoga poses which are excellent for managing blood pressure thereby reducing anxiety symptoms.”</span>
            <h2 class="inpara-head2">Yoga during Quarantine</h2>
            <span class="inpara-article">One of the best forms of physical, mental and spiritual practice, Yoga is best suited for this quarantine period. “Practice of yoga takes care of all these mental issues. Yoga along with breathing and meditation can be considered as an all-round exercise which will take care of our body, mind and soul. Hatha yoga practices are best suited for beginners. These practices also can have different variations which can make one perfect in the final poses. Some of these practices include Tadasana, Trikonasana, Ardha Kati Chakrasana and Veerbadrasana,” says Kutteri. Dandwate says that Yog Nidra is the most beneficial during these times. He says, “One of the most profound and powerful techniques that can be used is Yog Nidra. 20 minutes of Yog Nidra every day can help immensely in overcoming stress and anxiety.”</span>
